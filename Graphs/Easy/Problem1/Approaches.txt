As we have to find path exists or not lets go with BFS
Create a adjacency list/ matrix to keep track of graph edges 
	Keep in mind its a bidirectional graph we have to maintain adjacency accordingly
Traverse BFS from source:
maintain the visited set to not visit again the visited nodes
Add source to queue 
Remove node from queue if we found destination then return true;
If node is not in visited array 
	explore the child and add those are node visited in visited set
end if we exhausted the search return false;   


TC : O(E) (creation of adjacency list) + O(V+E) = V+E
SC = (V+E) adjacency list + Max(E) (queue at a time ) = V+E
